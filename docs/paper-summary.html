<h2>Paper 1: A Tool for Simulating Multi Response Linear Model Data</h2>
<p>As an extension of <span class="citation">Sæbø, Almøy, and Helland (2015)</span> to simulate linear model data with multiple response variables, this paper discusses the simulation model, the strategy for simulation, and compares some multivariate methods using simulated data. Additionally, it includes an R-package called <code>simrel</code> that is built based on the mathematical formulation discussed in the paper.</p>
<p>The simulation of the linear model discussed here is based on the concept of the relevant components. A subspace of the predictor space, which is relevant for a subspace of response space, is the basis of the simulation tool. These subspaces are assumed to be spanned by a subset of respective latent components. The simulation strategy started with identifying the covariance between these components that satisfy the user’s condition for the data, i.e. the simulation parameters. A covariance structure of the latent space is then created which is rotated by an arbitrary orthogonal rotation matrix to obtain the population covariance structure of the simulated data. Data is then sampled from a normal distribution with the constructed covariance structure. The tool also provides mathematically computed properties of the data such as true regression coefficient, minimum model error, coefficient of determination and the predictor variables relevant for a given response.</p>
<p>In addition to the mathematical formulation for simulation, the study compares some multivariate methods including OLS, PCR, PLS and Envelope using two simulation examples. It has included some derivatives of PLS such as PLS1, PLS2, CPLS and CPPLS and some methods based on envelope estimation such as Xenv, Yenv and Senv. The first example has three relevant response components rotated into five response variables. Additionally, four simulation designs were constructed using factorial design with low and high multicollinearity interacting with low and high noise levels. The simultaneous envelope (Senv) method has achieved the smallest prediction error with a smaller number of components in the dataset with low noise level (high coefficient of determination), while canonical PLS (CPLS and CPPLS) have shown better performance in the dataset with a higher level of noise. All the methods are found robust for the multicollinearity problem. The second example compares PLS1 and PLS2 where, on most occasions, the latter dominates the earlier with regard to minimum prediction error. Further, the paper has also introduced the shiny <span class="citation">(Chang et al. 2018)</span> web application designed for easier access to the simulation tool.</p>

<h2>Paper 2: Model and Estimators for PLS Regression</h2>
<p>Comparison of methods requires us to understand the modelling approach of the corresponding methods. This paper formulates five different ways to present a PLS model <span class="citation">(Helland 1990)</span> and shows how they are equivalent. Additionally, it argues that the concept of relevant components for reduction of the regression model is the simplest way for it. My contribution to the paper was to compare the performance of PCR, PLS, Bayes PLS and Envelope (Xenv) methods using both simulated and real data.</p>
<p>The comparison was based on simulated data with 32 unique properties through a factorial design of simulation parameters. The parameters include medium and high levels of coefficient of determination, medium and high levels of multicollinearity, four different position index of relevant predictor components and two different <span class="math inline">\(n/p\)</span> ratios, 0.3 and 0.8. The study is based on a single response model.</p>
<p>The study found some interesting results for the envelope and Bayes PLS methods. Since the Envelope (Xenv) method is based on maximum likelihood, the designs with <span class="math inline">\(n/p\)</span> ratio equals to 0.8 destroyed its prediction while the method has fine prediction when the ratio was 0.3. Bayes PLS has shown remarkable prediction performance in most design, however, both methods had convergence problem in many situations.</p>
<p>Despite having the best performance, Bayes PLS has time-consuming computation and failed to converge for some cases. For practical purpose, the study recommends the ordinary PLS algorithm as a good option for prediction purpose.</p>

<h2>Paper 3: Comparison of Multi Response Prediction Methods</h2>
<p>Since prediction has been an essential component in data science, understanding how the prediction methods interact with different properties of data is important. This paper, together with the next, makes a comprehensive comparison using simulated data with specifically designed properties through various simulation parameters. The experimental design in Figure <a href="background.html#fig:design-plot">4</a>, discussed in the previous section, has been used in both of these comparisons. Besides, for the prediction comparison, two real data examples have also been used in the study. These two papers try to give an understanding of the interaction between methods and data properties in multi-response cases and also assess the performance of the envelope methods (Xenv and Senv) using both simulation and data from the field of chemometrics. Further, these studies not only use prediction and estimation error for assessment but also the number of components used to get the minimum error. Here only methods based on relevant space such as PCR, PLS (PLS1 and PLS2) and Envelopes (Xenv and Senv) are considered for comparison.</p>
<p>Since envelope methods are unable to fit a model with <span class="math inline">\(p&gt;n\)</span>, principal components of the predictor matrix were used to reduce the number of predictors. The number of components that explains the minimum of 97.5% of the variation in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> are chosen. The regression coefficients were later transformed back using the respective eigenvectors. Since the envelope methods reduce the dimension as part of its fitting process, this detour in <span class="math inline">\(p&gt;n\)</span> cases does not give them extra benefit which we have tested for <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;p\)</span> cases using with and without principal components. This paper also illustrates the use of principal components for implementing envelope methods in data with wide <span class="math inline">\((p&gt;n)\)</span> predictor matrix which is common in fields like chemometrics and bioinformatics.</p>
<p>The minimum prediction error and the number of components to get that error are considered as observed responses in the study. The simulation parameters used in the experimental design are considered as factor variables for further statistical analysis. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) is used for proper statistical analysis with third-order interaction of these factors. The effect of different levels of the factors and their interactions are used for minute comparison.</p>
<p>Envelope methods in the study have produced a small prediction error using fewer components than other methods. The effect of correlation between the response variables is small for all methods, however, envelope methods are more sensitive to this correlation. All methods are robust for handling multicollinearity, but PCR and PLS methods struggle more when the relevant predictor components have small variance and irrelevant components have a large variance.</p>
<p>Example with real data shows PCR and PLS have the smallest prediction error, but the number of components used by these is higher than the envelope methods. Envelope methods in these examples have obtained prediction error closer to the minimum obtained by PCR and PLS, but using a smaller number of components.</p>

<div id="paper-4-comparison-of-multi-response-estimation-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Paper 4: Comparison of Multi Response Estimation Methods</h2>
<p>In many disciplines, the correct and stable estimation is just as an important primary objective as the prediction. This paper extends the analysis from Paper 3 to analyze the estimation aspect of the methods. The same experimental design and simulated data are used for this assessment as well.</p>
<p>The study found that overall performance highly depends on the nature of the data since simulation parameters, such as multicollinearity level and position of relevant predictors significantly interact with the methods. Since both envelope methods have smaller prediction and estimation error and have used fewer number of components, low multicollinearity with independent response variables are in favour of these methods. Higher correlations between the responses have given a larger estimation error for envelope methods. For these methods, choosing the wrong number of components can result in large estimation error, so the study also suggests using validation for estimation purpose. Both prediction and estimation error from PCR are more stable than other methods, while as PLS1 method models each response separately, the performance in general is poorer than other methods.</p>
