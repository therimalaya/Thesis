  Abstract =     {Data science is generating enormous amounts of data, and new
                  and advanced analytical methods are constantly being developed
                  to cope with the challenge of extracting information from such
                  ``big-data''. Researchers often use simulated data to assess
                  and document the properties of these new methods, and in this
                  paper we present an extension to the R-package simrel, which
                  is a versatile and transparent tool for simulating linear
                  model data with an extensive range of adjustable properties.
                  The method is based on the concept of relevant components, and
                  is equivalent to the newly developed envelope model. It is a
                  multi-response extension of R-package simrel which is
                  available in R-package repository CRAN, and as simrel the new
                  approach is essentially based on random rotations of latent
                  relevant components to obtain a predictor matrix X, but in
                  addition we introduce random rotations of latent components
                  spanning a response space in order to obtain a multivariate
                  response matrix Y. The properties of the linear relation
                  between X and Y are defined by a small set of input parameters
                  which allow versatile and adjustable simulations. Sub-space
                  rotations also allow for generating data suitable for testing
                  variable selection methods in multi-response settings. The
                  method is implemented as an update to the R-package simrel.},

  Abstract =     {We introduce envelopes for simultaneously reducing the
                  predictors and the responses in multivariate linear
                  regression, so the regression then depends only on estimated
                  linear combinations of X and Y. We use a likelihood-based
                  objective function for estimating envelopes and then propose
                  algorithms for estimation of a simultaneous envelope as well
                  as for basic Grassmann manifold optimization. The asymptotic
                  properties of the resulting estimator are studied under
                  normality and extended to general distributions. We also
                  investigate likelihood ratio tests and information criteria
                  for determining the simultaneous envelope dimensions.
                  Simulation studies and real data examples show substantial
                  gain over the classical methods, like partial least squares,
                  canonical correlation analysis, and reduced-rank regression.

  Year =         2002,
  Abstract =     {Principal component analysis is central to the study of
                  multivariate data. Although one of the earliest multivariate
                  techniques it continues to be the subject of much research,
                  ranging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas
                  from neural networks. It is extremely versatile with
                  applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this
                  book was the first comprehensive text written solely on
                  principal component analysis. The second edition updates and
                  substantially expands the original version, and is once again
                  the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material,
                  current research and a wide range of applications. Its length
                  is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in
                  statistics, or in other fields that use principal component
                  analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet
                  accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable
                  resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The
                  book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe
                  is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He
                  is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three
                  other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of
                  principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him
                  busy for over 30 years.},

  Abstract =     {We propose a new parsimonious version of the classical
                  multivariate normal linear model, yielding a maximum
                  likelihood estimator (MLE) that is asymptoti- cally less
                  variable than the MLE based on the usual model. Our approach
                  is based on the construction of a link between the mean
                  function and the covariance ma- trix, using the minimal
                  reducing subspace of the latter that accommodates the former.
                  This leads to a multivariate regression model, which we call
                  the envelope model, where the number of parameters is
                  maximally reduced. The MLE from the envelope model can be
                  substantially less variable than the usual MLE, especially
                  when the mean function varies in directions that are
                  orthogonal to the directions of maximum variation for the
                  covariance matrix.}

                  method for prediction, first used by chemometricians, but also
                  now by statisticians in a number of applied fields. The method
                  can in a natural way be connected to a statistical model which
                  now has been ex- tended and further developed in terms of an
                  envelope model. Concentrating on the uni- variate case, the
                  model is here approached from several points of view. Several
                  estimators of the regression vector in this model are defined,
                  including the ordinary PLS estimator, the maximum likelihood
                  envelope estimator and a recently proposed Bayes PLS
                  estimator. The different estimators are compared with respect
                  to prediction error by systematic sim- ulations. The main
                  conclusion from the simulations seems to be that Bayes PLS
                  performs well compared to the other methods in virtually all

  Abstract =     {Data science is generating enormous amounts of data, and new
                  and advanced analytical methods are constantly being developed
                  to cope with the challenge of extracting information from such
                  ``big-data''. Researchers often use simulated data to assess
                  and document the properties of these new methods, and in this
                  paper we present an extension to the R-package simrel, which
                  is a versatile and transparent tool for simulating linear
                  model data with an extensive range of adjustable properties.
                  The method is based on the concept of relevant components, and
                  is equivalent to the newly developed envelope model. It is a
                  multi-response extension of R-package simrel which is
                  available in R-package repository CRAN, and as simrel the new
                  approach is essentially based on random rotations of latent
                  relevant components to obtain a predictor matrix X, but in
                  addition we introduce random rotations of latent components
                  spanning a response space in order to obtain a multivariate
                  response matrix Y. The properties of the linear relation
                  between X and Y are defined by a small set of input parameters
                  which allow versatile and adjustable simulations. Sub-space
                  rotations also allow for generating data suitable for testing
                  variable selection methods in multi-response settings. The
                  method is implemented as an update to the R-package simrel.},

                  for the random x case with many explanatory variables. Model
                  reduction is done by conditioning upon only a small number of

                  the development of new methods for statistical inference and
                  prediction is the focus of many studies. The requirement to
                  document the properties of new methods is inevitable, and
                  often simulated data are used for this purpose. However, when
                  it comes to simulating data there are few standard approaches.
                  In this paper we propose a very transparent and versatile
                  method for simulating response and predictor data from a
                  multiple linear regression model which hopefully may serve as
                  a standard tool simulating linear model data. The approach
                  uses the principle of a relevant subspace for prediction,
                  which is known both from Partial Least Squares and envelope
                  models, and is essentially based on a re-parametrization of
                  the random x regression model. The approach also allows for
                  defining a subset of relevant observable predictor variables
                  spanning the relevant latent subspace, which is handy for
                  exploring methods for variable selection. The data properties
                  are defined by a small set of input-parameters defined by the
                  analyst. The versatile approach can be used to simulate a
                  great variety of data with varying properties in order to
                  compare statistical methods. The method has been implemented
                  in an R-package and its use is illustrated by examples.},

  Abstract =     {Abstract. The random x regression model is approached through
                  the group of rotations of the eigenvectors for the
                  x-covariance matrix together with scale transformations for
                  each of the corresponding regression coefficients. The partial
                  least squares model can be constructed from the orbits of this
                  group. A generalization of Pitman's Theorem says that the best
                  equivariant estimator under a group is given by the Bayes
                  estimator with the group's invariant measure as the prior. A
                  straightforward application of this theorem turns out to be
                  impossible since the relevant invariant prior leads to a
                  non-defined posterior. Nevertheless we can devise an

  Abstract =     {Regression tends to give very unstable and unreliable
                  regression weights when predictors are highly collinear.
                  Several methods have been pro- posed to counter this problem.
                  A subset of these do so by finding components that summarize
                  the information in thepredictorsandthe criterion variables.The
                  present paper compares six such methods (two of which are
                  almost completely new) to ordinary regression: Partial least
                  Squares (PLS), Principal Component regression (PCR), Principle
                  covariates regression, reduced rank regression, and two
                  variants of what is called power regression. The comparison is
                  mainly done by means of a series of simulation studies, in
                  which data are constructed in various ways, with different
                  degrees of collinearity and noise, and the methods are
                  compared in terms of their capability of recovering the
                  population regres- sion weights, as well as their prediction
                  quality for the complete population. It turns out that
                  recovery of regression weights in situations with collinearity
                  is often very poor by allmethods, unless the regression
                  weights lie in the subspace spanning the first few principal
                  components of the predictor variables. In those cases,
                  typically PLS andPCRgive the best recoveries of regression
                  weights.The picture is inconclusive, however, because,
                  especially in the study with more real life like simulated
                  data, PLS and PCR gave the poorest recoveries of regres- sion
                  weights in conditions with relatively low noise and
                  collinearity. It seems that PLS and PCR are particularly
                  indicated in cases with much collinearity, whereas in other
                  cases it is better to use ordinary regression.Asfar as
                  prediction is concerned: Prediction suffers far less from
                  collinearity than recovery of the regression weights.},

                  traditional objectives. The author offers a balance between
                  foundations and methodology by integrating illustrative
                  examples that show how envelopes can be used in practice. He
                  discusses how to use envelopes to target selected coefficients
                  and explores predictor envelopes and their connection with

                  envelopes can be used in generalized linear models,
                  regressions with a matrix-valued response, and reviews work on

  Abstract =     {Efficient estimation of the regression coefficients is a
                  fundamental problem in multivariate linear regression. The
                  envelope model proposed by Cook et al. (2010) was shown to
                  have the potential to achieve substantial efficiency gains by
                  accounting for linear combinations of the response vector that
                  are essentially immaterial to coefficient estimation. This
                  requires in part that the distribution of those linear
                  combinations be invariant to changes in the nonstochastic
                  predictor vector. However, inference based on an envelope is
                  not invariant or equivariant under rescaling of the responses,
                  tending to limit application to responses that are measured in
                  the same or similar units. The efficiency gains promised by
                  envelopes often cannot be realized when the responses are
                  measured in different scales. To overcome this limitation and
                  broaden the scope of envelope methods, we propose a scaled
                  version of the envelope model, which preserves the potential
                  of the original envelope methods to increase efficiency and is
                  invariant to scale changes. Likelihood-based estimators are
                  derived and theoretical properties of the estimators are
                  studied in various circumstances. It is shown that estimating
                  appropriate scales for the responses can produce substantial
                  efficiency gains when the original envelope model offers none.
                  Simulations and an example are given to support the
                  theoretical claims.},

  Abstract =     {Multivariate regression is considered with emphasis on
                  prediction. Ordinary least squares tends to yield unstable
                  estimates and consequently uncertain predictions when there
                  are few observations in the training data compared to the
                  number of parameters to be estimated. Thus, there is a need
                  for methods that work well in such situations. This article
                  presents a new alternative prediction method based on
                  reduced-rank regression. The method of reduced-rank regression
                  uses a certain decomposition of the ordinary least squares
                  estimate of the matrix of regression coefficients, and shrinks
                  the last terms of this decomposition exactly to 0. I suggest a
                  new method with soft shrinkage of the terms in the
                  decomposition. Furthermore, the reduced-rank regression, as
                  well as the new softly shrunk reduced-rank regression, are
                  combined with principal components regression. The methods are
                  modified to handle missing observations in the response
                  variables. The various methods are compared through a
                  simulation study. Softly shrunk reduced-rank regression,
                  possibly combined with principal components, turns out to be
                  the best overall method, and the improvement over ordinary
                  least squares is particularly large in situations with few
                  observations.},

                  Laboratory Systems, 18: 251-263. A novel algorithm for partial
                  least squares (PLS) regression, SIMPLS, is proposed which
                  calculates the PLS factors directly as linear combinations of
                  the original variables. The PLS factors are determined such as
                  to maximize a covariance criterion, while obeying certain
                  orthogonality and normalization restrictions. This approach
                  follows that of other traditional multivariate methods. The
                  construction of deflated data matrices as in the nonlinear
                  iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)-PLS algorithm is
                  avoided. For univariate y SIMPLS is equivalent to PLS1 and
                  closely related to existing bidiagonalization algorithms. This
                  follows from an analysis of PLS1 regression in terms of Krylov
                  sequences. For multivariate Y there is a slight difference
                  between the SIMPLS approach and NIPALS-PLS2. In practice the
                  SIMPLS algorithm appears to be fast and easy to interpret as
                  it does not involve a breakdown of the data sets.

                  methodologyassumes multivariate normality and is a true
                  generalisation of the classical multivariate tests - any
                  imaginable test statistic is allowed. The generalised test
                  statistics are dependent on the unknown covariance matrix.
                  Rotation testing handles this problem by conditioning on
                  sufficient statistics. Compared to permutation tests, we
                  replace permutations by proper random rotations. Permutation
                  tests avoid the multinormal assumption, but they are limited
                  to relatively simple models. On the other hand, a rotation
                  test can, in particular, be applied to any multivariate
                  generalisation of the univariate F-test. As an important
                  application, a detailed description of howeach single response
                  p-value can be non- conservatively adjusted for multiplicity

                  Bonferroni), and it is a generalisation of the ordinary F-test
                  (except for the computation by simulations). Hence, this paper
                  offers an exact Monte Carlo solution to a classical problem of
                  multiple testing.},

                  number of explanatory variables is large, then the common
                  least squares multiple regression solution may not be the best
                  one. We give a methodology for comparing certain alternative
                  prediction methods by asymptotic calculations and perform such
                  a comparisons for four specific methods. The results indicate
                  that none of these methods dominates the others, and that the
                  difference between the methods typically (but not always) is
                  small when the number of observations is large. In particular,
                  principal component regression does well when the eigenvalues
                  corresponding to components not correlated with the dependent
                  variables (i.e., the irrelevant eigenvalues) are extremely
                  small or extremely large. Partial least squares regression
                  does well for intermediate irrelevant eigenvalues. A maximum
                  likelihood-type method dominates the others asymptotically, at
                  least in the case of one relevant component.},

                  provides a promising approach to such problems, by restricting
                  attention to d {\textless} n linear combinations of the

  Abstract =     {A Partial Least Squares based approach is described which can

                  between predictor variables used for prediction or
                  classification. Within a wide range of research areas (e.g.
                  biomedicine, functional genomics, proteomics, chemometrics)
                  modern measurement technology has increased the possibility to
                  measure a very large number of variables on a given sample,
                  whereas the number of samples usually is limited. As is well
                  known, the large set of variables may cause many traditional
                  statistical methods to report a high number of false positives
                  due to collinearity and multiple testing issues. Further, most
                  existing methods for data modelling and variable selection do
                  not take advantage of possibly known dependencies between
                  variables. The modified LPLS-regression method proposed here
                  may take background knowledge on variables into account,
                  thereby increasing the accuracy of estimates and reducing the
                  number of false positives. The potential gain is better
                  variable selection and prediction. The LPLSR is an extension
                  of PLS-regression, where, in addition to response and
                  regressor matrices, an extra data matrix is constructed which
                  summarises the background information on the regressor
                  variables. We illustrate the potential of the LPLSR-approach
                  for this matter on both simulated and real data.

  abstract =     "While data science is battling to extract information from the
                  enormous explosion of data, many estimators and algorithms are
                  being developed for better prediction. Researchers and data
                  scientists often introduce new methods and evaluate them based
                  on various aspects of data. However, studies on the impact
                  of/on a model with multiple response variables are limited.
                  This study compares some newly-developed (envelope) and
                  well-established (PLS, PCR) prediction methods based on real
                  data and simulated data specifically designed by varying
                  properties such as multicollinearity, the correlation between
                  multiple responses and position of relevant principal
                  components of predictors. This study aims to give some insight
                  into these methods and help the researcher to understand and
                  use them in further studies."

                  methods, principal components regression (PCR) and partial
                  least squares regression (PLS), are compared using simulation
                  studies of complex chemical mixtures which contain a large
                  number of components. Details of the complex mixture model,
                  including concentration distributions and spectral
                  characteristics, are presented. Results from the application
                  of PCR and PLS are presented, showing how the prediction
                  errors and number of latent variables (NLV) used vary with the
                  relative abundance of mixture components. Simulation
                  parameters varied include the distribution of mean
                  concentrations, spectral correlation, noise level, number of
                  mixture components, number of calibration samples, and the
                  maximum number of latent variables available. In all cases,
                  except when artificial constraints were placed on the number
                  of latent variables retained, no significant differences were
                  reported in the prediction errors reported by PCR and PLS. PLS
                  almost always required fewer latent variables than PCR, but
                  this did not appear to influence predictive ability."
