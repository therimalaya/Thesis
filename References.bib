	Abstract = {Data science is generating enormous amounts of data, and new and advanced analytical methods are constantly being developed to cope with the challenge of extracting information from such ``big-data''. Researchers often use simulated data to assess and document the properties of these new methods, and in this paper we present an extension to the R-package simrel, which is a versatile and transparent tool for simulating linear model data with an extensive range of adjustable properties. The method is based on the concept of relevant components, and is equivalent to the newly developed envelope model. It is a multi-response extension of R-package simrel which is available in R-package repository CRAN, and as simrel the new approach is essentially based on random rotations of latent relevant components to obtain a predictor matrix X, but in addition we introduce random rotations of latent components spanning a response space in order to obtain a multivariate response matrix Y. The properties of the linear relation between X and Y are defined by a small set of input parameters which allow versatile and adjustable simulations. Sub-space rotations also allow for generating data suitable for testing variable selection methods in multi-response settings. The method is implemented as an update to the R-package simrel.},

	Abstract = {While data science is battling to extract information from the
                  enormous explosion of data, many estimators and algorithms are
                  being developed for better prediction. Researchers and data
                  scientists often introduce new methods and evaluate them based
                  on various aspects of data. However, studies on the impact
                  of/on a model with multiple response variables are limited.
                  This study compares some newly-developed (envelope) and
                  well-established (PLS, PCR) prediction methods based on real
                  data and simulated data specifically designed by varying
                  properties such as multicollinearity, the correlation between
                  multiple responses and position of relevant principal
                  components of predictors. This study aims to give some insight
                  into these methods and help the researcher to understand and
                  use them in further studies.},
