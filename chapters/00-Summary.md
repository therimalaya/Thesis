A linear regression model defines a linear relationship between two or more random variables. The random variables that depend on other random variables are often called response variables and the independent random variables are called predictor variables. In most cases not all variations are relevant for regression, i.e. only a certain amount of variations in predictors are relevant for a part of variations in response. This leads to a reduction of the linear regression model where one can imagine a subspace of the space spanned by the predictor variables that contains all the relevant information for a subspace spanned by the response variables. 

In this thesis, we attempt to compare some new methods which are based on the envelope model and some established methods such as principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLS). The comparison tests these methods on their performance of producing minimum prediction and estimation error while modelling data simulated with specifically designed properties. For the simulation, we have also created an R-package called `simrel` with a web interface.

A simulation model for a multi-response multivariate linear model on which the simulation tool is based on is discussed in the first paper. This paper prepares a basic foundation for the simulations with the concept of reduction of regression models. The second paper discusses the similarities of the envelope, PCR and PLS population models. This paper compares the prediction performance of several multivariate methods using a model with a single response.
