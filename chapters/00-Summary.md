A linear regression model defines a linear relationship between two random variables. The random variables that depend on other random variables is often called response variables and the independent random variables is called predictor variables. In most cases, not all information contained in the predictor variables is relevant for the response variables. Similarly, not all information contained in the response variables is informative. This leads to a reduction of the linear regression model where one can imagine a subspace in the predictor variables that contains all the relevant information for a subspace in the response variables. Many prediction and estimation methods have used this concept to construct their methods and have claimed to produce better prediction with low estimation error. 

This thesis attempts to compare some new methods which are based on envelope model and some established methods such as principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLS). The comparison tests these methods on their performance of producing minimum prediction and estimation error while modeling data simulated with specifically designed properties. For the simulation, we have also created an R-package called `simrel` with a web interface.

A simulation model for a multi-response multivariate linear model on which the simulation tool is based on, is discussed on the first paper. This paper prepares a basic foundation for the simulation with the concept of reduction of regression model. The second paper discusses the similarities of envelope, PCR and PLS population models. This paper compares the prediction performance of several multivariate methods using model with single response.
